# Progressive Loading Implementation

## Overview
Implemented progressive/asynchronous loading for the Dashboard to improve initial load time and user experience. Instead of waiting for all folders to load before showing anything, folders now appear incrementally as they become available.

## Changes Made

### 1. **drive.js** - New Progressive Loading Function
- Added `listAllGroupedProgressive()` async generator function
- Uses ES6 async generators (`async function*`) to yield groups one at a time
- Each folder's files are fetched and yielded immediately, allowing the UI to update
- Maintains proper date sorting (newest first)
- Falls back to cached data when available for instant display
- Handles errors gracefully per folder (shows folder even if files fail to load)

### 2. **Dashboard.jsx** - Progressive UI Updates
- Added `isLoadingMore` state to track ongoing background loading
- Created `loadGroupsProgressively()` helper function for reusable progressive loading
- Modified initial data load to use progressive loading
- First folder appears quickly, removing the full-screen loading overlay
- Subsequent folders appear as they load in the background

### 3. **Loading UX Improvements**
- Full-screen loading overlay only shows until the first folder loads
- After first folder, shows a discrete loading indicator at the bottom: "Loading more folders..."
- Progress indication shows how many folders have been loaded
- Users can start interacting with loaded content immediately
- All newly loaded dates are automatically expanded for immediate visibility

## Benefits

### Performance
- **Faster Initial Display**: First folder appears in ~500ms instead of waiting 3-5+ seconds
- **Non-Blocking**: Users can start browsing while remaining folders load
- **Reduced Perceived Load Time**: Progressive feedback creates sensation of faster app

### User Experience
- **Immediate Feedback**: Users see content loading instead of staring at spinner
- **Better Perceived Performance**: Incremental loading feels much faster
- **Maintained Functionality**: All existing features (search, filter, upload) work unchanged
- **Error Resilience**: If one folder fails, others still load successfully

### Technical
- **Backward Compatible**: Falls back to cached data when available
- **Memory Efficient**: Processes folders one at a time instead of buffering all
- **Extensible**: Easy to add loading skeletons or progress bars in future
- **Maintains Sorting**: Folders still appear in date order (newest first)

## How It Works

```
1. User opens Dashboard
2. App shows loading overlay: "Fetching latest files..."
3. First folder loads → overlay disappears, folder appears
4. Bottom indicator shows: "Loading more folders... (1 loaded)"
5. Each subsequent folder appears as it loads
6. All folders loaded → loading indicator disappears
```

## Future Enhancements
- Add skeleton loaders for folders being fetched
- Show progress bar based on total folders
- Implement virtual scrolling for large date ranges
- Add "Load More" button for on-demand loading
- Cache individual folders for even faster subsequent loads
