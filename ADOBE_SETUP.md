# Adobe PDF Embed API Setup Guide

## ðŸ”‘ Getting Your Adobe API Key

To use Adobe PDF Embed API in your newspaper application, you need to get a free API key from Adobe:

### Step 1: Create Adobe Developer Account

3. Click "Create new project"

### Step 2: Add PDF Embed API
1. In your project, click "Add API"
2. Select "PDF Embed API" from the list
3. Choose "Web" as your platform
4. Enter your domain (for development: `http://localhost:5173`)

### Step 3: Get Your Credentials

2. Copy this Client ID - this is your API key

### Step 4: Update Your Environment Variables
Add your Adobe Client ID to your `.env` file in the frontend directory:
