# PWA Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed
1. ✅ Red theme color changed to cyan/blue to match app design
2. ✅ PDF preview thumbnails not showing in PWA

## Changes Made

### 1. Theme Color Updates
**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/public/manifest.json`
- `frontend/index.html`

**Changes:**
- Changed `theme_color` from `#DC2626` (red) to `#0891b2` (cyan)
- This matches the app's main color scheme (cyan/blue gradients)

### 2. Service Worker Updates
**File Modified:** `frontend/public/service-worker.js`

**Changes:**
- Updated cache version from `v1` to `v2` to force cache refresh
- Added blob URL support (skip caching blob: protocol URLs)
- Added CDN bypass for pdf.js libraries:
  - `cdnjs.cloudflare.com` - for pdf.js worker
  - `cdn.jsdelivr.net` - for pdf.js assets
- Added `/drive/` path bypass to ensure thumbnail API calls always use network
- These changes ensure PDF thumbnails can be generated properly in PWA mode

## How to Test

1. **Uninstall the old PWA** (if installed)
2. **Hard refresh** the page (`Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Cmd + Shift + R`)
3. **Reinstall the app** - you should see:
   - Cyan/blue theme color in the app header (not red)
   - PDF thumbnails loading properly on the dashboard
4. **Test offline mode** - app shell should still work offline

## Technical Details

### Why thumbnails weren't working:
- Service worker was caching/blocking API requests to `/api/drive/file/:fileId`
- PDF.js CDN resources were being intercepted
- Blob URLs weren't properly excluded

### Solution:
- Excluded `/drive/` paths from service worker interception
- Added CDN domain bypasses
- Added blob: protocol support
- Bumped cache version to clear old caches

## Color Scheme Reference
- Primary: `#0891b2` (cyan-600)
- Gradient: `#06b6d4` to `#3b82f6` (cyan to blue)
- Background: `#E5FBFF` (light cyan)
- Accent: `#B8E6F0` (lighter cyan)
